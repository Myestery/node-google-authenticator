# Node Google Authenticator Backend Service

## Description

A server-side Node application with two-factor authentication. Heavily inspired by Marcin Wanago's [express-typescript](https://github.com/mwanago/express-typescript) repository. 

This is a small backend service that can be hosted as a micro-service or integrated into an existing node application to provide two-factor authentication (2FA) using an authenticator app, like Google Authenticator. In addition, it is forward thinking and comes with support for QR codes.

This is a companion repository to an [article](https://medium.com/@allistair.vilakazi/2fa-with-node-js-and-google-authenticator-7ddd44881493) I wrote on two-factor authentication with Node and Google Authenticator.
